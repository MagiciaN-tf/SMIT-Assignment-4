    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a student of Saylani Mass IT training Program, and I'm currently
      learning HTML.<br />
      So here's I created an About page and a recipe of MAGGI NODDLES which you
      can check it right
      <a href="index.html">here</a>. This is just a sample page for html
      practice of linking URLs.
